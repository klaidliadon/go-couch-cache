go-couch-cache
============

Package `couchcache` provides an implementation of [httpcache.Cache](https://github.com/gregjones/httpcache/blob/master/httpcache.go#L30) that stores and retrieves data using a Couchdb ([client](http://github.com/cabify/go-couchdb)).

It's based on [mgo-cache](https://github.com/mcuadros/go-mgo-cache).
